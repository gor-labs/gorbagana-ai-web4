## 🌐 What is Gorbagana?

**Gorbagana** is a decentralized, AI-powered **Web4 Terminal** designed to:
- Blend **modular AI agents** with Web4 functionality.
- Integrate Solana/EVM wallets like **Phantom**, **Solflare**, **MetaMask**.
- Act as a universal raider console and on-chain assistant.
- Run **trash-powered** simulations, oracles, and more.

> Built for speed. Designed for chaos. Powered by memes.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **AI Agent System** – Modular character logic (Moper, Raider, Terminal Agent, x agent, rspace xai).
- 🔐 **Wallet Integration** – as of now we connect with bagpack processing with Phantom, Solflare, MetaMask, Keplr.
- ⚙️ **Terminal UI** – Full-screen interactive interface with plugin support.
- 🧩 **Custom Plugins** – Add your own modules or commands for plugins.
- ⛓ **Cross-chain Logic** – Designed for Solana layer, EVM, and beyond, $gor use as gas fees.
- 🗑️ **Trash Index** – Fuel your chain with junk-data powered simulations.
